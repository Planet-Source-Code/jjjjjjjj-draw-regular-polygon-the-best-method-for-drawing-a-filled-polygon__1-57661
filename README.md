## Draw Regular Polygon \-  The Best Method for drawing a filled Polygon\.


</div>

### Description

This is a 'Draw Polygon' function which can draw a regular-filled Polygon.The main importance of this code is that, you need only to specify the 'Side-length' and only one 'Co-ordinate'.It is not needed to specify all the verticies included. It can draw unlimited sides and can 'Rotate' the polygon about the centre as well as the specified vertex.You can specify the filling color by setting the "FillColor' of the PictureBox. It works smooth and fast. It contains some equations which derived myself. Please rate this code and never forget to add Feedback.If you found it useful "PLEASE VOTE FOR ME'. Good luck !
